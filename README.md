# Spelling Bee Hints userscript

This userscript replaces the hint panel in NY Times Spelling Bee puzzle with a more informative
version.  

Features:

* Displays most of the hint info you'd normally see on SB's "Today's Hints" page, without having to click back and forth between the hints page and puzzle, or having to count words manually to see what's left.
* Displays cute bee emoji once you've won üêù

# Install

Click this link: https://github.com/cdaddr/spelling-bee-hints/raw/main/spelling-bee-hints.user.js and Tampermonkey should prompt you to install the user script.  That's all.  The next time you visit Spelling Bee in browser, it should replace the hint box with my custom version.  This is the "Raw" link Github provides for `spelling-bee-hints.user.js` in this repo.

This works with Tampermonkey in Firefox and Chrome on 15 Mar 2023.  Changes by NYT to the HTML/JS of Spelling Bee are likely to break this script at some time in the future if I stop maintaining it.
